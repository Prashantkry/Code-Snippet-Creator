# create a new project in the current directory and all command at a glance 
npm create svelte@latest
npm run dev -> start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
npm run build -> To create a production version of your app

```

## Developing
Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` start a development server.
You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
